# Bouncing-Boy
Some boy is bouncing. Catch him!
9/27:Added a Button to start the game
Added an ImageButton to move around
Added a TextView to display the score
9/30:Learning how animation works. Still a bunch of research to go
10/3:I'm trying to figure out how to cleanly animate the button now. I also meant to send this in yesterday but forgot. Oops
10/3:After a bit of research, it apears I need to use something called a runnable. I still can't get it working yet but I'm very close
10/4:Updating an object that needs to be created on startup is, to my knowledge, impossible to do with a runnable. So now I need to find another way
10/6:It might not fit the original idea exactly but it is very close. Dynamic animation is apparently hard? Idk, I need more time to get it working. I will add a timer if I can figure it out
10/7:The timer is giving me a bit of trouble but I've been given a hint to check out 'csterdroids' on Prof Madden's github so we'll see how that works out
