# Bouncing-Boy
Some boy is bouncing. Catch him!
9/27:Added a Button to start the game
Added an ImageButton to move around
Added a TextView to display the score
9/30:Learning how animation works. Still a bunch of research to go
10/3:I'm trying to figure out how to cleanly animate the button now. I also meant to send this in yesterday but forgot. Oops
10/3:After a bit of research, it apears I need to use something called a runnable. I still can't get it working yet but I'm very close
